# Fortran file reading

## JSON

I'm using a JSON reader from [here](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/json-fortran/tree/8.2.0) and incorporating
it into my program to read my JSON input file.

Set the appropriate variables in the shell script `compile-rd-json.sh` to point to the JSON-Fortran library, 
then in a terminal run:

```
./compile-rd-json.sh
```

to compile the `rd-json` executable.
